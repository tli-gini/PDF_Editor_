- **Modular Components**: Navbar, Footer, ToolSidebar, DropZone, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first breakpoints
- **Themed UI**: CSS variables + Google Fonts
- **API Integretion**: Communicates with Stirling PDF backend via internal API routes (proxy layer)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React
- API Proxy: Next.js API Routes (to call Stirling PDF endpoints securely)
- External PDF engine: Stirling PDF (via HTTP endpoints)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pdf-editor.git
cd pdf-editor
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Configure PDF API Endpoint

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
# Example for demo (public Fly.io deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_API_URL=https://stirling-pdf-yourname.fly.dev

```

## 📦 Deployment Options

### Public / Portfolio Use (Vercel + Fly.io)

- Frontend hosted on Vercel
- Stirling PDF backend hosted on Fly.io
- Proxy requests securely through Next.js API routes
- Suitable for demos, academic showcases, and testing

### Internal Company Use (Docker in Intranet)

- Frontend and Stirling PDF backend hosted within internal network
- Requests routed through API proxy to avoid exposing endpoints

## 🐳 Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Production Stage
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app .
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## 📄 .env.example

```env
# Public API URL for Stirling PDF server
NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_API_URL=https://stirling-pdf-yourname.fly.dev
```

## 🧩 Integration

- Requests are routed through Next.js API routes to ensure:
  - Cross-origin safety: avoids CORS issues
  - Credential privacy: sensitive API info stays server-side
- By changing the NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_API_URL environment variable, the same UI can connect to:
  - A public backend (e.g. Fly.io)
  - A private server (e.g. intranet Docker deployment)
- No additional backend logic or database is required
- Compatible with Stirling PDF v1.34+ (AGPL-3.0)

## 📝 Notes

- Dark mode is handled via `class="dark"` and Tailwind's `dark:` variants
- All fonts are preloaded with `next/font/google` and exposed via CSS variables
- Responsive design is implemented using Tailwind's breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.), ensuring the UI adapts smoothly from mobile to desktop screens
- Modular component architecture makes it easy to extend or adapt
